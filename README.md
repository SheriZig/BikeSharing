# Ride Sharing 
## Overview 
Thinking back on a two-week vacation and looking at the vacation photos, the majority of them we take during sight seeing using the services of Citi Bike (a bike sharing service). The photos sparked the idea to start a similar ride sharing service in Des Moines, IA. A perspecive Angel Invester was found. The invester is intrigued by the idea but wants additional information analyis before making a final decision. 

New York ride sharing data was obtained and an analysis was conducted for a presentation to the perspective investor. 

The analysis focused on the total number of trips, time of day when the trips were taken, and user data.

## Summary 
Based on the data, there is a high ridership before and after the traditional working hours with the primary customer being male. larges number of riders are during the 8:00 hour with 170,730 riders, 5:00 hour with 224,566 and 6:00 hours with 215,783.

The duration for the vast majority of the trips are less than six minutes. Which indicates that riders prefer to use the service for short trips to a destination as opposed to for the health benefits that a longer ride would provide. The number of riders based on duration steadily increases to peak at 6 minutes with 145,147 riders the steadily decreasing per minute. After the one hour mark, for the second hour ridership starts at 923 trips and ends the hour at 93. The number of rides for the third hour are all less than 100 for the duration of the third hour. Although the majority of the riders are male, when looking at longer durations (over an hour) there is no perceptible difference between males and females. 

When considering customer types, users prefer to utilize the prepay subscription service instead of 'pay as you go'. Subscription service accounted for 81% (1,900,359) of rides with total 'pay as you go' being 443,865 rides. 

Additional analysis relating to population would be benificial. Population will be important to consider due to it being one of the significant differences between the two locations. An analysis of the weather in Des Moines should also be considered to determine the number of days (compared to New York) that bike riding will be reasonable based on conditions.
